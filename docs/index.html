    M2S-CGM is a detailed architectural simulator
	that models the interactions between CPUs and GPUs operating in
	heterogeneous compute environments. M2S-CGM extends an existing
	and established x86 CPU model and Southern Islands GPU model,
	adds a new custom-built memory system model and switching fabric
	called CGM, and incorporates a well-known SDRAM model. The CGM
	memory system simulator provides configurable end-to-end system sim-
	ulation and can support a range of non-coherent and coherent CPU-
	GPU configurations. M2S-CGM supports the runtime for OpenCL-based
	benchmarks in addition to traditional multithreaded CPU benchmarks
	and can run select benchmarks from established heterogeneous bench-
	mark collections. This allows us to experiment with different coherent
	CPU-GPU configurations and propose effective future improvements in
	these systems.

    <p>
    Abstract: We introduce M2S-CGM a detailed architectural
	simulator that models the interactions between CPUs and GPUs
	operating in coherent heterogeneous compute environments.
	M2S-CGM extends an existing and established x86 CPU model
	and Southern Islands GPU model, adds a new custom-built
	memory system model and switching fabric called CGM, and
	incorporates a well-known SDRAM model. The CGM memory
	system simulator provides configurable entire system simulation
	and can support a range of non-coherent and coherent CPU-GPU
	configurations. M2S-CGM supports the runtime for OpenCL-
	based benchmarks in addition to traditional multithreaded CPU
	benchmarks and can run benchmarks from established hetero-
	geneous benchmark collections. This allows us to experiment with
	different coherent CPU-GPU configurations and propose effective
	future improvements in these systems. We present the makeup of
	M2S-CGM’s software architectural design, provide a validation
	of the simulator, and provide coherent CPU-GPU execution
	results. Our validation results show average differences between
	our physical test system and M2S-CGM, of 10.4%, 22%, and
	6.4% for 2 threaded, 4 threaded, and heterogeneous benchmark
	runs respectively. Our coherent CPU-GPU experimental results
	show an average speedup of 2.8 for our benchmarks over the
	baseline noncoherent system.
